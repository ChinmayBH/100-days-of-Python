      "1. **Navigation Bar/Menus:**\n",
      "    - The top bar displays the RIB logo and the pinned project name (\"72415: Residential Tower Helsinki /1 / Structural Works / 000120\").\n",
      "    - Tabs like \"Estimate,\" \"Estimate by Activities,\" \"Estimate by BoQ,\" and \"Estimate by 3D\" are present, indicating navigation options.\n",
      "    - Toolbar icons and a search bar contribute to a structured layout.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Multiple Panels/Sections:**\n",
      "    - The screenshot shows multiple panels:\n",
      "        - Left panel: A hierarchical structure containing a breakdown of project elements with folders and sub-folders.\n",
      "        - Center panel: A table presenting data in rows and columns.\n",
      "        - Right panel: Divided into the \"3D Viewer\" and \"Totals\" sections.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Tables/Grids:**\n",
      "    - The center panel is a table with clear headers and data, showcasing project information and calculations.\n",
      "    - The \"Totals\" section on the right presents a summary in a table format.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Software Layout Reference:**\n",

    "You will be provided with some text and an images from RIB 4.0 documentation and you need to describe the additional information image can give in comparison with text provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "Background Information:\n",
    "RIB 4.0 is an enterprise project lifecycle management software that integrates planning, construction, and operation on a single platform. It utilizes 6D BIM to link 3D models, time, cost, and sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "you need to first classifying Screenshots of Enterprise Software: \n",
    "You will be provided with an image, and your task is to classify it as one of the following:\n",
    "- Application Screenshot \n",
    "- Other/Normal image\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following rules to guide your classification:\n",
    "## For Application Screenshot\n",
    "1) Navigation Bar or Menus\n",
    " - Check for a navigation bar at the top or side of the image.\n",
    "Look for:\n",
    "- Application name or logo (e.g., RIB logo).\n",
    "- Pinned project name following the logo.\n",
    "- Standard menus like File, Edit, View, etc.\n",
    "- Action buttons (e.g., Save, Undo, Redo).\n",
    "- Structured Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Identify the presence of multiple panels or sections:\n",
    "- Lists, tables, or grids showcasing data.\n",
    "- Sidebar menus or collapsible sections.\n",
    "- A status bar at the bottom with summaries (e.g., totals, active settings, or notifications).\n",
    "- Data Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Look for tables or grids displaying rows and columns of actionable data.\n",
    "- Check for headers, inline-editing options, or detailed settings visible in the interface.\n",
    "- For Pop-Up or Sectional Part of the Application\n",
    " - Sometimes it can be Focused on a specific task or dialog (e.g., login screen, setting adjustments).\n",
    "- May include the navigation bar, sidebar menus, or status bar typically seen in a full application window.\n",
    " - Sometimes it can represents a smaller part of the application, not the entire interface.\n",
    " - Contains fewer panels or a single functional element.\n",
    " - Can shows a single or lesser activities and focusing on specific action\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Software Layout Reference\n",
    "      1. **Desktop Layout**:\n",
    "        - URL entry leads to a desktop page with module tiles.\n",
    "        - Only authorized module tiles are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "      2. **Module Layout**:\n",
    "        - Module name displayed at top left.\n",
    "        - Module toolbar below the name (includes options like Save, Refresh, Help).\n",
    "        - Multiple tabs may be present next to the application menu.\n",
    "        - Sidebar on the far right (Search, Wizard, Report options).\n",
    "        - Main workspace contains multiple containers, potentially with their own toolbars and tabs.\n",
    "        - Workspace content can be saved as a view.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Instructions for Screenshot Analysis:\n",
    "      1. Context Review:\n",
    "        - Note the one-liner description of the overall task to be accomplished.\n",
    "      2. General Overview:\n",
    "        Briefly describe the main interface visible in the current screenshot, including any visible tabs or major containers.\n",
    "      3. Navigation Context:\n",
    "        Make a note of current tab name and container name(s).\n",
    "        Note: \"The user has navigated to the tab [Tab Name] and the container [Container Name].\"\n",
    "        You can identify the current tab as, \n",
    "          - Look for a toolbar near the top of the interface with common functions like save, refresh, and help.\n",
    "          - Adjacent to this toolbar, you'll find a row of tabs.\n",
    "          - The active tab is visually distinct, typically having a lighter background color compared to the inactive tabs.\n",
    "          - This lighter background often makes the active tab appear to be \"in front\" of the others, creating a visual connection to the content below.\n",
    "        You can identify the current container as,\n",
    "          - Within the active tab's content area, you'll see multiple smaller window-like sections.\n",
    "          - These containers are visually separated from each other, often with borders or spacing.\n",
    "          - Each container has a distinct header area, usually colored in a light grey or similar neutral tone.\n",
    "          - The container's name or title is typically located in the top-left corner of this header.\n",
    "          - Adjacent to the name, you'll often find a toolbar specific to that container's functionality.\n",
    "          - The content area below the header displays the data or interface elements relevant to that container's purpose.\n",
    "      4. Callout Analysis:\n",
    "        For each callout (numbered or unnumbered):\n",
    "        a. Numbered Callouts:\n",
    "            - Note the callout number.\n",
    "            - Proceed with icon check or non-icon analysis as in previous instructions.\n",
    "        b. Unnumbered Callouts:\n",
    "            - Interpret as a single action, likely a click operation.\n",
    "            - Describe what is being clicked (e.g., button, tile, entry in a table).\n",
    "        c. Icon Check:\n",
    "            - If the callout highlights an icon, use the icon dictionary to interpret the action.\n",
    "            - When encountering an icon in the screenshot:\n",
    "              a. First, attempt to match it visually with an icon from the dictionary.\n",
    "              b. If a match is found, use the exact description provided in the dictionary.\n",
    "              c. If no exact match is found, then provide a best guess of the icon's function based on its appearance and context, but clearly label it as a guess.\n",
    "        d. Non-Icon Analysis:\n",
    "            - If it's a \"create new\" operation:\n",
    "              - Note if it's creating an entry without opening a form.\n",
    "              - Distinguish between selecting an existing entry and creating a new one.\n",
    "            - If it's highlighting a value unrelated to a \"create\" operation:\n",
    "              - Interpret as noting the field value for comparison.\n",
    "      5. Data Entry vs. Selection:\n",
    "        - For actions that appear to be selections in a table:\n",
    "          - Determine if it's actual data entry or just a selection based on the context and previous steps.\n",
    "          - If it's data entry, note: \"This is a data entry step, creating a new entry in the [Container Name].\"\n",
    "          - If it's a selection, note: \"User selects an existing entry in the [Container Name].\"\n",
    "      6. Step Correlation:\n",
    "        If step information is provided, associate each callout with the corresponding step.\n",
    "      7. Clarity and Consistency:\n",
    "        - Use exact terms and labels visible in the screenshot.\n",
    "        - Present the analysis in a clear, structured format.\n",
    "      8. Additional Notes:\n",
    "        - Analyze only the areas with callouts (numbered or unnumbered).\n",
    "        - If any callout is ambiguous or doesn't fit the expected patterns, state that it requires additional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Other/Normal image\n",
    " - The image does not belong to the application interface (e.g. Formulae, error messages, unrelated diagrams, or external visuals).\n",
    " - Lacks any clear indicators of being part of the software.\n",
    " - Summarize the image in proper explainable words such that soul idea of the image will get captured.\n",
